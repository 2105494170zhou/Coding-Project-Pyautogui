# NMH App Auto-Opener

This project is a Python automation script I made to open my school websites automatically.  
It uses PyAutoGUI and OpenCV to control the mouse, keyboard, and detect images on the screen.  

When I run the program, it asks which app I want to open — like Canvas, Gmail, Google Docs, or the Dining Hall Menu — and then it moves the cursor, types, and clicks through the right spots to open it.  

It can recognize buttons and pop-ups using screenshots I took from my own screen, and it clicks them automatically.  
I built this because I often open the same few pages every day, and I wanted a faster way to do it without searching or clicking each time.  

This project helped me learn about Python automation, screen image detection, and timing control between actions.
